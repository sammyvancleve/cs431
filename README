RESULTS FROM SIMULATIONS
by Sammy Van Cleve

(N = number of devices)

Binary Backoff
--------------
N=10 -- 44 timeslots
N=20 -- 196 timeslots
N=40 -- 281 timeslots
N=80 -- 342 timeslots

As is clear in these results, the more devices that are attempting to send
frames, the longer it will take when accounting for exponential binary
backoff.  However, the increase does not seem to be just linear.

This is likely because when a large enough range of delays is selected
(such as 0-255), a smaller difference in the number of devices
will not necessarily increase the amount of time. Even with more devices, 
it will still be choosing within a large range, and it is possible that 
a group of smaller devices will have one device delaying much longer.
Here, a larger group of devices could all send their frames earlier without
any more collisions, given the large possible range.

Hubs vs Switches
----------------
resuts over 1000 simulated timeslots, averaged from 5 runs

% of frames delivered: Hub
N=10 -- 0.1243% delivered
N=20 -- 0% delivered
N=40 -- 0% delivered

% of frames delivered: Switch
N=10 -- 19.24% delivered
N=20 -- 18.83% delivered
N=40 -- 18.78% delivered

Because a single collision occurs on a hub when any two devices are sending
frames, frames are only sent successfuly when the number of devices is very
low (all the devices are in the same collision domain, higher number of
devices means a larger collision domain).

In comparison, only devices sending to another device or its destination
are in its collision domain when using a switch.  When the number of 
devices increases, the range of possible random sources and destinations 
do too -- so while there are more frames being sent by more devices, the 
likelihood of each device sending to a device in its collision domain stays
(relatively) low.
(collision domains stay small even as number of devices increases)
